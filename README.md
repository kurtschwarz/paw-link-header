# Link Header Parser for Paw

A [Paw Extension](https://paw.cloud/extensions) to parse and follow [`Link`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988) headers in requests. This is especially useful for APIs that support [cursor based](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/pagination/) pagination and, of course [GitHub's API](http://developer.github.com/v3/#pagination).
